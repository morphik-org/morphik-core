question,answer
"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Below is a summary of the requested calculations and how they tie into Palantir’s Q1 2025 Rule of 40 result.

1) Year-over-year revenue growth rates
   • Total revenue
     – Q1 2024: \$634 M → Q1 2025: \$884 M
     – Growth = (884 – 634)/634 ≈ +39%¹
   • Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts
     – Q1 2024: \$610 M → Q1 2025: \$879 M
     – Growth = (879 – 610)/610 ≈ +44%²
   • US revenue
     – Q1 2024: \$406 M → Q1 2025: \$628 M
     – Growth = (628 – 406)/406 ≈ +55%³

2) Dispersion of those three growth rates
   – Values: {39%, 44%, 55%}
   – Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46%
   – Population σ = sqrt([ (–7)² + (–2)² + (+9)² ] / 3 ) ≈ 6.7pp
   – (If treated as a sample, s ≈ 8.2pp)

3) Quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 (Q2 2023→Q1 2025)⁴
   – Rule of 40 by quarter:
     Q2 2023 38% → Q3 2023 46% (+8pp)
     Q3 2023 46% → Q4 2023 54% (+8pp)
     Q4 2023 54% → Q1 2024 57% (+3pp)
     Q1 2024 57% → Q2 2024 64% (+7pp)
     Q2 2024 64% → Q3 2024 68% (+4pp)
     Q3 2024 68% → Q4 2024 81% (+13pp)
     Q4 2024 81% → Q1 2025 83% (+2pp)
   – Q-on-Q change vector: {+8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2}
   – Mean change ≈ +6.43 pp
   – Population σ ≈ 3.5 pp

4) Relation to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score (83%)
   – Despite moderate dispersion in pure revenue‐growth rates (σ ≈ 6.7 pp), Palantir’s combined growth-plus-profit metric (Rule of 40) has risen steadily each quarter with relatively low quarter-to-quarter volatility (σ ≈ 3.5 pp).
   – The high Rule of 40 score of 83% in Q1 2025 thus reflects not only strong standalone revenue growth but also consistent operating-margin improvement, yielding one of the strongest “growth + profitability” readings in the two-year span.

"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Below is the back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation showing that Palantir’s operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell by roughly 23% year-over-year from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025.

**1. Extract the key numbers**
- Q1 2024 total revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts (slide “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts”): $610 M
- Q1 2025 total revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts: $879 M
- Q1 2024 adjusted operating income (slide “Q1 2025 adjusted operating income…” chart): $226 M
- Q1 2025 adjusted operating income: $391 M
- U.S. commercial customer count, TTM Mar 31, 2024 (slide “US Commercial Customer Count”): 262
- U.S. commercial customer count, TTM Mar 31, 2025: 432

**2. Compute operating expense**
Operating Expense ≈ Revenue – Adjusted Op Income
- Q1 2024: $610 M – $226 M = $384 M
- Q1 2025: $879 M – $391 M = $488 M

**3. Compute expense per U.S. commercial customer**
- Q1 2024: $384 M / 262 ≈ $1.466 M per customer
- Q1 2025: $488 M / 432 ≈ $1.130 M per customer

**4. Year-over-year change**
% Change ≈ (1.130 – 1.466) / 1.466 ≈ –0.337 / 1.466 ≈ –23%

**Answer:** Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer decreased by about 23% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in Total Other Assets

   - As of January 26, 2025: $ 6,425 million
   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
   Change = $ 6,788 M − $ 6,425 M = **$ 363 million**

2. Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions of Property, Equipment and Intangible Assets
   - Q1 FY 2026: $ 408 million
   - Q1 FY 2025: $ 147 million
   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
   Increase = $ 408 M − $ 147 M = **$ 261 million**
   (Note 8 – Property and Equipment, “acquired by assuming related liabilities…”)

3. Intangible-Asset Amortization as a Percentage of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions
   - Amortization expense (Q1 FY 2026): $ 159 million
   - Acquisitions (Q1 FY 2026): $ 408 million
   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
   Percentage = (159 / 408)×100 ≈ **39%**

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The fair value of CoreWeave on April 27, 2025 was $1 000 million, and the reclassification adjustment against non-marketable equity securities in Q1 FY26 was $843 million.

1 000 − 843 = 157

So, the fair value exceeded the carrying-value reclassification adjustment by **$157 million**.

"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here are the figures under the (incorrect) assumption that the 83% “Rule of 40” is the sum of the Q-over-Q US government-revenue growth rate and the adjusted free-cash-flow margin:

- US government revenue Q/Q growth: +9% (“US government revenue grew +45% Y/Y and +9% Q/Q…”)
- Adjusted free-cash-flow margin: 42% (“…adjusted free cash flow of $370 million; 42% margin”)
- Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and US Treasury securities: $5.4 billion

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","After pulling the amounts from the two schedules and computing year-over-year changes, we get:

1.  Cash-flows from ops adjustments
    – Stock-based comp. + Depreciation & amortization
    • Apr 27, 2025: $1,474 + 611 = $2,085 million
    • Apr 28, 2024: $1,011 + 410 = $1,421 million
    → Growth = (2,085 – 1,421) / 1,421 ≈ 46.7%

2.  Income‐statement “other” items
    – Net change in unrealized gain/(loss) on AFS securities
    – Total other income (expense), net
    • Apr 27, 2025: 139 + 272 = 411 million
      (Net unrealized gain:)
        – Comprehensive Income, “Available-for-sale securities: Net change in unrealized gain (loss)”: 139
        – Income Statement, “Total other income (expense), net”: 272
    • Apr 28, 2024: (128) + 370 = 242 million
      (Net unrealized loss of 128 plus other income of 370)
    → Growth = (411 – 242) / 242 ≈ 69.8%

Comparison
– The combined unrealized‐gain + other‐income line grew ~69.8% year-over-year, versus ~46.7% for stock-comp + D&A.
– Thus, the “unrealized gains + other income” metric grew faster by ≈ 23.1 percentage points.

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The deck shows that overall Q1 2025 revenue was up 39% Y/Y, while revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts was up 44% Y/Y. 44% – 39% = 5 percentage points."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Here’s how the three pieces break down, all in millions except where noted:

1)  Standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter change in estimated fair value
   From the “contractual maturity” table (Note 5):

   | Maturity          | Apr 27 ’25 Fair Value | Jan 26 ’25 Fair Value | Change (Δ)         |
   |-------------------|----------------------:|----------------------:|-------------------:|
   | < 1 year          |              25,781   |              18,450   |    7,331           |
   | 1–5 years         |              26,355   |              23,656   |    2,699           |
   | Total (all terms) |              52,136   |              42,106   |   10,030           |

   • Δs = [7,331; 2,699; 10,030]
   • Mean Δ = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030)/3 ≈ 6,687
   • Population variance = [(7,331–6,687)² + (2,699–6,687)² + (10,030–6,687)²] / 3 ≈ 9.17 × 10⁶
   • σ = √9.17 × 10⁶ ≈ 3,028

   → **Std. dev. ≈ \$3.03 billion**

2)  Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities (Jan 26 ’25)
   From the “Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities” schedule (Note 5):

   Corporate debt securities at Jan 26 ’25
   – Amortized cost: \$18,504 M
   – Unrealized gain: **\$51 M**
   – Unrealized loss: \$29 M

3)  % increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value
   From the Level 1 fair‐value table (Note 6):

   – Jan 26 ’25: \$3,760 M
   – Apr 27 ’25: \$6,522 M
   – Increase: 6,522 – 3,760 = \$2,762 M
   – %Δ = 2,762 / 3,760 ≈ **73.5 %**

Finally, as the footnote to the loss‐rollforward states, “Gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.”"
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","First, we compute the sequential “accelerations” in each GAAP line item:

  1. GAAP operating income
     • Q3 → Q4 2024 change:
       11.0 – 113.1 = –102.1 (millions)
     • Q4 → Q1 2025 change:
       176.0 – 11.0 = +165.0
     ⇒ Acceleration = 165.0 – (–102.1) = +267.1 M

  2. GAAP net income
     • Q3 → Q4 2024 change:
       79.0 – 143.5 = –64.5
     • Q4 → Q1 2025 change:
       214.0 – 79.0 = +135.0
     ⇒ Acceleration = 135.0 – (–64.5) = +199.5 M

Finally, the operating‐income acceleration exceeds the net‐income acceleration by:
267.1 M – 199.5 M ≈ **67.6 million dollars**."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of accrued & other current liabilities
   From the Condensed Balance Sheet (Note 8):
   •  Jan 26, 2025:
      – Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$2,095 million
      – Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$11,737 million
      ⇒ 2,095 / 11,737 ≈ 17.9 %
   •  Apr 27, 2025:
      – Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$4,310 million
      – Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$19,211 million
      ⇒ 4,310 / 19,211 ≈ 22.4 %

   Change = 22.4 % − 17.9 % ≃ **4.6 percentage points**

2. Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply/capacity obligations vs. net long-term debt
   From Note 11: outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply obligations = \$29.8 billion
   From Note 10: net long-term carrying amount of debt = \$ 8.464 billion

   \$29.8 B / \$8.464 B ≃ **352 %**

"For NVIDIA’s quarter ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of its remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year was unbilled, and for Palantir in Q1 2025, what percentage of its total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election?","**Answer:**

1. **NVIDIA (quarter ended April 27, 2025)**
   In Note 8 “Deferred Revenue” to the Q1 2025 10-Q, NVIDIA discloses that remaining performance obligations (RPO) on contracts > 1 year amounted to \$1.8 billion, of which \$160 million “has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue.”
   - Unbilled RPO percentage = \$160 M / \$1,800 M ≈ **8.9%**

2. **Palantir (Q1 2025)**
   In the Q1 2025 Appendix “Additional Metrics and Notes,” Palantir reports total RPO of \$1.90 billion, of which \$1.00 billion is classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election.
   - Long-term RPO percentage = \$1.00 B / \$1.90 B ≈ **52.6%**

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM periods ending Mar 31, 2024 and Mar 31, 2025:

- Global commercial customers grew from 427 to 622, an increase of 195 customers.
- U.S. commercial customers grew from 262 to 432, an increase of 170 customers.

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","1. Operating lease obligations by fiscal year (in $ millions)

2. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from FY 2026 to FY 2028
   CAGR = (349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ 12.9%

3. Relation to new lease commitments
   • In Note 14, NVIDIA discloses that “between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of $7.4 billion, primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”
   • The roughly 13% annual growth in existing lease obligations through FY 2028 reflects the early stages of this build-out and supports the company’s plan to add $7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases over FY 2026–FY 2030."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a short calculation of the two series’ quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth rates and their standard deviations (σ), followed by the ratio and its interpretation.

1. Compute the QoQ growth rates for each series over the four TTM quarters ending 3/31/25:

   • US commercial customer count
     – Mar ’24→Jun ’24: 262 → 295 ⇒ +13%
     – Jun ’24→Sep ’24: 295 → 321 ⇒ +9%
     – Sep ’24→Dec ’24: 321 → 382 ⇒ +19%
     – Dec ’24→Mar ’25: 382 → 432 ⇒ +13%
     ⇒ rates = [0.13, 0.09, 0.19, 0.13]

   • Total customer count
     – Mar ’24→Jun ’24: 554 → 593 ⇒ +7%
     – Jun ’24→Sep ’24: 593 → 629 ⇒ +6%
     – Sep ’24→Dec ’24: 629 → 711 ⇒ +13%
     – Dec ’24→Mar ’25: 711 → 769 ⇒ +8%
     ⇒ rates = [0.07, 0.06, 0.13, 0.08]

2. Calculate the (population) standard deviation of each four-quarter series:

   – σ_commercial ≈ 3.6%
   – σ_total       ≈ 2.7%

3. Take the ratio:

   ratio = σ_commercial / σ_total
         ≈ 3.6% / 2.7%
         ≈ 1.33

Interpretation
A ratio of roughly 1.3× means that quarter-to-quarter growth in the US commercial customer base has about 30% more dispersion than total customer count growth. In other words, even though management reports a smooth-sounding +65% year-over-year increase in US commercial customers, the underlying quarterly gains were noticeably more volatile (i.e., had larger swings) than overall customer-count growth."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","1. Interest income increased by \$156 million (from \$359 million in Q1 FY 2025 to \$515 million in Q1 FY 2026).
2. Other income (expense), net declined by \$255 million (from a \$75 million gain in Q1 FY 2025 to a \$180 million expense in Q1 FY 2026).
3. Management attributed the decline primarily to unrealized losses in its publicly-held equity securities due to fair-value volatility—particularly investments in CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.

"Management asserted that Palantir delivered an 85% adjusted gross margin, sub-$450 million of adjusted expenses, and $220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders in Q1 2025; what do the reconciliation tables actually report for those three metrics?","Here’s what the appendix reconciliation tables actually show for Q1 2025 (all figures unaudited, per the slides):

1.  Adjusted gross margin
    – From “Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin”
      •  Gross profit $710,885
      •  + Stock-based compensation $15,016
      → Adjusted gross profit $725,901
      → Adjusted gross margin 82%
      (Not 85% as stated.)

2.  Adjusted operating income (vs. “sub-$450 M of adjusted expenses”)
    – From “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin”
      •  Income from operations $176,048
      •  + Stock-based compensation $155,339
      •  + Employer payroll taxes related to SBC $59,323
      → Adjusted operating income $390,710
      → Adjusted operating margin 44%
      (Thus the business generated ~$391 M of adjusted operating income, not “sub-$450 M of adjusted expenses.”)

3.  GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders
    – From “Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted”
      •  Net income attributable to common stockholders $214,031
      – rather than $220 M as asserted.

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, NVIDIA’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs went from $ (37) million to $ (36) million—a $1 million reduction.  Since the aggregate scheduled principal across all long-term debt maturities is $8,500 million (3,750 + 1,250 + 3,500), that $1 million change represents:

   $1 million / $8,500 million ≈ 0.0118%

In other words, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs decreased by roughly 0.01% of the total scheduled long-term debt principal.

"Which four factors did NVIDIA cite in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, what was that effective tax rate, and what estimated long-term annual effective tax rate did Palantir apply to its income tax effect for market-vesting SARs?","Here’s the comparison:

1. NVIDIA (Note 4 to Q1 FY2026 10-Q)
   – NVIDIA’s stated effective tax rate for Q1 FY 2026 was 14.3% (income tax expense of $3.1 billion on pretax income).
   – They said this rate was below the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate “primarily due to” four items:
     1. Tax benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction (FDII)
     2. Tax benefit on stock-based compensation
     3. Income earned in jurisdictions taxed at rates below the U.S. federal rate

   - Apr 27, 2025:
     • Current assets = \$15,234 + 38,457 + 22,132 + 11,333 + 2,779 = \$89,935 million
     • Current liabilities = \$7,331 + 19,211 = \$26,542 million
     → NWC = \$89,935 – \$26,542 = \$63,393 million

   → Quarter-over-quarter NWC change = \$63,393 – \$62,079 = \$1,314 million

2. Retained earnings increase
   – Jan 26, 2025 retained earnings = \$68,038 million

The gap between those two figures is 61% – 5% = 56 percentage points.

"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","1. NVIDIA’s $4.5 billion H2O excess‐inventory charge on $4.6 billion of pre‐license H2O sales corresponds to about 98%
   (4.5 ÷ 4.6 ≈ 97.8%).
2. Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating‐cash‐flow margin was 35%, so 98% exceeds 35% by roughly 63 percentage points.

"What is the full applicability date of the EU AI Act, what licensing requirement and compliance deadline would the US government's ""AI Diffusion"" IFR have imposed on NVIDIA's H200 and GB200 data center products, and which NVIDIA product category would the USG's ""Connected Vehicle"" import restrictions affect?","1. EU AI Act full applicability date
   - The EU AI Act “became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period” (i.e. August 1, 2026).¹

2. “AI Diffusion” IFR licensing requirement & compliance deadline for H200/GB200
   - IFR published January 15, 2025 would have imposed a worldwide export-licensing requirement on all AI-related semiconductors classified under ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a or their “.z” counterparts—including the H200 and GB200 data-center GPUs.
   - It carried a 120-day delayed compliance period (i.e. licenses would have been required by ~May 15, 2025).²

3. “Connected Vehicle” import restrictions’ affected NVIDIA product category
   - The U.S. Government’s “Connected Vehicle” restrictions target the import and sale of certain automotive products.³

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The two metrics you’re asking about are quoted on pp. 21–22 of the Outlook:

1. Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey shows that a net 61 percent of investors expect further dollar depreciation.
2. J.P. Morgan’s “simultaneous declines” indicator for U.S. equity, bond and FX markets has run at about 7.5 percent of trading days on a three-year rolling basis.

If you divide 61 percent by 7.5 percent, you get a ratio of roughly 8.1 ×.

By contrast, the same note (p. 21) tells us that over the past 20 years an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has exhibited almost twice the volatility (≈ 2 ×) of a pure U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio.

– Ratio of net-dollar-bearishness to three-year “sell-everything” days: 61 / 7.5 ≈ 8.1 ×
– Volatility multiple of unhedged ex-U.S. vs. U.S. bonds: ≈ 2 ×

So the “sentiment-to-sell-off” ratio (≈ 8 ×) is about four times larger than the 20-year bond-volatility multiple (≈ 2 ×)."
