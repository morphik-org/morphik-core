"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","Year-over-Year Growth Rates  
1. Total revenue: +39% Y/Y (Page 21)  
2. Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts: +44% Y/Y (Page 22)  
3. US revenue: +55% Y/Y (Page 18)  

Standard deviation of these three Y/Y rates (population basis)  
= 6.68 percentage points  
Calculation:  
• Mean = (39% + 44% + 55%)/3 = 46%  
• Variance = [(39–46)² + (44–46)² + (55–46)²]/3  
= (49 + 4 + 81)/3 = 44.667  
• Std dev = √44.667 ≈ 6.68%

Q4 2024 81% +13  
Q1 2025 83% +2  

Standard deviation of these seven QoQ changes (population basis)  
= 3.50 percentage points  
Calculation:  
• Mean Δ = (8+8+3+7+4+13+2)/7 ≈ 6.43  
• Variance = Σ(Δ–6.43)²/7 ≈12.24  
• Std dev = √12.24 ≈ 3.50  

Relation to Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)  
• The Y/Y revenue-growth rates show moderate dispersion (±6.68 pp around 46%), indicating some variability across Palantir’s top-line segments.  
• The QoQ Rule of 40 changes are relatively stable (±3.50 pp around a +6.43 pp average increase), reflecting consistent improvement in combined growth + margin.  
• At 83% in Q1 2025 (Page 32), the Rule of 40 score substantially exceeds its quarter-to-quarter volatility, underscoring robust and sustained operational performance.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
