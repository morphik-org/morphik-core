# Morphik Security and Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
This document details 3 critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the Morphik codebase during a security audit and code review. The bugs range from high-severity security vulnerabilities to performance issues that could affect system reliability.

## Bug #1: Overly Permissive CORS Configuration (HIGH SEVERITY)

### **Classification:** Security Vulnerability - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
### **File:** `core/api.py` (Lines 122-128)
### **Severity:** HIGH

### **Problem Description:**
The CORS middleware was configured with dangerous wildcard permissions that allowed any website to make authenticated requests to the Morphik API:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],          # ❌ DANGEROUS: Allows ANY website
    allow_credentials=True,       # ❌ DANGEROUS: With credentials enabled
    allow_methods=["*"],          # ❌ DANGEROUS: All HTTP methods
    allow_headers=["*"],          # ❌ DANGEROUS: All headers
)
```

### **Security Impact:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Malicious websites could make authenticated requests on behalf of users
- **Token Theft:** User authentication tokens could be stolen by malicious websites
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive user data could be accessed from untrusted origins
- **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious sites could perform admin actions if users had elevated permissions

### **Exploitation Scenario:**
1. User logs into Morphik in one browser tab
2. User visits a malicious website in another tab
3. Malicious website makes API calls to Morphik using the user's session
4. Attacker gains full access to user's Morphik data and functionality

### **Fix Applied:**
Implemented environment-aware CORS configuration that restricts origins based on deployment mode:

```python
# Cloud mode - only official Morphik domains
if settings.MODE == "cloud":
    allowed_origins = [
        "https://morphik.ai",
        "https://app.morphik.ai", 
        "https://www.morphik.ai",
        f"https://{settings.API_DOMAIN}",
    ]
# Self-hosted mode - localhost and configured domains
else:
    allowed_origins = [
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000", 
        "http://localhost:8000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
        f"http://{settings.HOST}:{settings.PORT}",
        f"https://{settings.API_DOMAIN}",
    ]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=allowed_origins,  # ✅ Specific allowed origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "PATCH"],  # ✅ Specific methods
    allow_headers=["Authorization", "Content-Type", "Accept", "X-Requested-With", "X-CSRF-Token"],  # ✅ Specific headers
)
```

### **Security Benefits:**
- Prevents CSRF attacks from unauthorized domains
- Reduces attack surface by limiting allowed HTTP methods and headers
- Maintains functionality while enforcing security boundaries
- Different security profiles for cloud vs. self-hosted deployments

## Bug #2: Weak JWT Secret Keys in Development Mode (MEDIUM-HIGH SEVERITY)

### **Classification:** Security Vulnerability - Cryptographic Weakness
### **File:** `core/config.py` (Lines 166-167)
### **Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH

### **Problem Description:**
JWT secret keys used weak, predictable defaults in development mode:

```python
"JWT_SECRET_KEY": os.environ.get("JWT_SECRET_KEY", "dev-secret-key"),
"SESSION_SECRET_KEY": os.environ.get("SESSION_SECRET_KEY", "super-secret-dev-session-key"),
```

### **Security Impact:**
- **Token Forgery:** Anyone knowing these default values could create valid JWT tokens
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could impersonate any user or admin
- **Production Risk:** Weak secrets could accidentally be used in production
- **Predictable Secrets:** Hardcoded values are easily discoverable in source code

### **Exploitation Scenario:**
1. Attacker discovers the default secret keys in source code
2. Attacker creates JWT tokens with admin privileges using the known secret
3. Attacker gains full system access without valid credentials
4. Attacker can impersonate any user in the system

### **Fix Applied:**
Implemented secure random secret generation for development mode with proper validation:

```python
dev_mode = config["auth"].get("dev_mode", False)

# Generate secure random secrets for development if not provided
import secrets
dev_jwt_secret = secrets.token_urlsafe(64) if dev_mode else None
dev_session_secret = secrets.token_urlsafe(64) if dev_mode else None

auth_config = {
    "JWT_SECRET_KEY": os.environ.get("JWT_SECRET_KEY", dev_jwt_secret),
    "SESSION_SECRET_KEY": os.environ.get("SESSION_SECRET_KEY", dev_session_secret),
    # ... other config
}

# Enhanced validation
if not auth_config["dev_mode"]:
    # Production mode requires explicit environment variables
    if "JWT_SECRET_KEY" not in os.environ:
        raise ValueError("JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable is required when dev_mode is disabled")
    if "SESSION_SECRET_KEY" not in os.environ:
        raise ValueError("SESSION_SECRET_KEY environment variable is required when dev_mode is disabled")
else:
    # Development mode validation with warning
    if not auth_config["JWT_SECRET_KEY"]:
        raise ValueError("Failed to generate secure JWT secret for development mode")
    logger.warning(
        "Running in development mode with auto-generated secrets. "
        "Tokens will be invalid after server restart."
    )
```

### **Security Benefits:**
- Uses cryptographically secure random secrets (64-byte URL-safe tokens)
- Enforces explicit secret configuration in production
- Prevents accidental use of weak defaults
- Provides clear warnings about development mode behavior
- Secrets change on each restart in dev mode (preventing long-term token abuse)

## Bug #3: Race Condition in PerformanceTracker (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

### **Classification:** Performance Issue - Race Condition
### **File:** `core/api.py` (Lines 62-104)
### **Severity:** MEDIUM

### **Problem Description:**
The `PerformanceTracker` class had race conditions in phase timing that could lead to incorrect performance measurements:

```python
def start_phase(self, phase_name: str):
    # End current phase if one is running
    if self.current_phase and self.phase_start:
        self.phases[self.current_phase] = time.time() - self.phase_start  # ❌ Could double-count
    
    # Start new phase
    self.current_phase = phase_name
    self.phase_start = time.time()

def log_summary(self, additional_info: str = ""):
    # End current phase if still running
    if self.current_phase and self.phase_start:
        self.phases[self.current_phase] = time.time() - self.phase_start  # ❌ Could double-count
```

### **Performance Impact:**
- **Incorrect Metrics:** Performance measurements could be inaccurate or duplicated
- **Memory Leaks:** Overlapping phases could accumulate incorrect timing data
- **Debugging Issues:** Unreliable performance data makes optimization difficult
- **Resource Waste:** Incorrect measurements could lead to poor resource allocation decisions

### **Race Condition Scenarios:**
1. Multiple rapid calls to `start_phase()` causing overlapping measurements
2. Calling `log_summary()` multiple times leading to double-counting
3. Starting the same phase multiple times without proper state tracking
4. Concurrent access in multi-threaded environments

### **Fix Applied:**
Implemented proper state tracking and phase management:

```python
class PerformanceTracker:
    def __init__(self, operation_name: str):
        # ... existing init
        self._phase_ended = False  # ✅ Track if current phase was already ended

    def start_phase(self, phase_name: str):
        current_time = time.time()
        
        # ✅ End current phase if running and not already ended
        if self.current_phase and self.phase_start and not self._phase_ended:
            duration = current_time - self.phase_start
            # ✅ Accumulate duration if phase already exists
            if self.current_phase in self.phases:
                self.phases[self.current_phase] += duration
            else:
                self.phases[self.current_phase] = duration

        # ✅ Start new phase only if different from current
        if phase_name != self.current_phase:
            self.current_phase = phase_name
            self.phase_start = current_time
            self._phase_ended = False

    def end_phase(self):
        # ✅ Explicit phase ending with state tracking
        if self.current_phase and self.phase_start and not self._phase_ended:
            duration = time.time() - self.phase_start
            if self.current_phase in self.phases:
                self.phases[self.current_phase] += duration
            else:
                self.phases[self.current_phase] = duration
            self._phase_ended = True

    def add_suboperation(self, name: str, duration: float):
        # ✅ Accumulate durations for repeated operations
        if name in self.phases:
            self.phases[name] += duration
        else:
            self.phases[name] = duration
```

### **Performance Benefits:**
- Prevents double-counting of phase durations
- Allows phase restarts without timing corruption
- Accumulates durations for repeated phases correctly
- Provides more accurate performance metrics
- Reduces memory overhead from duplicate entries
- Better support for concurrent usage patterns
